# WIP 0.1.0

- cleanup

# WIP 0.0.8

- implement `clone()` for `ActorRef`
- ActorProps now receive the `Context<A>` as parameter when creating a new Actor
  - this way the User can store the `Context<Self>` inside his Actor Struct
- removed `Context<A>` from ActorTrait functions
  - if you need to Access the Context within any of these functions, consider Storing it as part of your Actor Struct
- remove default behavior for `SystemStopMessage`
  - This was done, because we lost the reference to `Context<A>` in the Trait function
- ActorStopMessage and SystemStopMessage are no longer directly accessible by the User
  - to stop an actor use `.stop();`, this ensures that the actor is also removed from the list of running actors
- replace magic in thread pool config
  - thread_pools are now configured with `min`, `max`, and `factor`
- Added round robin router with usage example 

- Remoting:
  - All necessary Remoting preparations are included in this Release. With these changes Remoting is in itself a possibility, although at this point in time no Remoting Library is provided
  - Added `SerializedMessage`
  - Added `fn handle_serialized_message(&self, msg: SerializedMessage)` to Actor Trait
  - System now Stores `dyn ActorTrait` per `ActorAddress`
  - System now provides `send_to_addrress()` which takes an `ActorAddress` and a `SerializedMessage` to call `handle_serialized_message`
  

# 0.0.7

- Actors are now created through ActorProps
  - this was necessary to remove the `actor_backup` from the `ActorHandler` and to rework the System to no longer make use of `.clone()` calls on the Actor
- Remove `Clone` Trait from Actors and Messages
  - this is only possible because of the introduction of the ActorProps

# 0.0.6

- add ability to stop actor system
  - clean stop, sends SystemStopMessage to ALL actors
    - handling of SystemStopMessage can be defined per Actor
    - default handling sends an ActorStopMessage to simply stop the Actor as soon as possible
  - if actors did not exit until timeout is reached, will force stop everything
  - this comes with a slight performance decrease, as we have to read the necessary AtomicBool in the core iteration, to know when to stop
- system internal messages will now call functions defined in ActorTrait
  - we can't implement a handler for these messages that can be overridden, but we can call trait functions for the ActorTrait to give the enduser the ability to configure the behavior
- finally made actor wakeup failsafe and increase time before running actors go back to sleep
- allow Actors to hold any ActorRef by explicitly implementing UnwindSafe for ActorRef 

# 0.0.5

- Actors can now be stopped by calling stop on an ActorRef
  - this sends a "StopMessage" to the Actor
  - all messages queued until the stop message is handled in the actor will still be executed
- fix ActorAddress generation used for Wakeup Calls  
- inject context into message handling
  - this allows the actor to interact with itself
  - this allows the actor to interact with the actor system

# 0.0.4

- Actor Wakeup: properly handle wakeup de-duplication
- added pre_start and post_stop to Actors

# 0.0.3

- fix ActorRef send mutability
- fix a Bug where message handlers could be executed manually on an ActorRef
- Actors now have a sleeping state
  - New Actors automatically start in this state until a message is received
  - Sleeping Actors do not use any CPU
  - After Wakeup, there's a hardcoded minimum interval of 1 second before an Actor is put to Sleep again

# 0.0.2

- added configurable actor restart mechanism
- performance increase by moving RwLock from Actor to ActorRef
- configurable message throughput per actor, with global default
- refactor + cleanup configuration
- allow dynamic creation of thread_pools through config
  - automatically start all configured thread_pools
- keep dependencies up2date
  - hard pin version for dependencies that do not have regular updates

# 0.0.1

- initial release. Each published release on https://crates.io/crates/tyractorsaur will be tracked in GitHub releases 
- core functionality is working
  - create system and spawn pools 
  - create actors and add them into pools of the existing system 
  - send messages to created actors
  - retrieve and handle messages in actor
